## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I spent a lot of time to make the whole thing responsive, and I'm satisfied with the result. The page works perfectly on desktop, tablet and phone.

### Continued development

Altough the page works pretty good on any device screens, I'm sure, that many technics I used are amateur, and wont work well in bigger projects. Cant wait to improve myself in the topic of responsive design.

### Useful resources

- [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com) - Without ChatGPT the whole think gonna be a huge timeconsuming struggle, but this AI is perfect for frontend design. I love because it doesn't just give me a perfect solution to the different problems, but also explains the why-s.
